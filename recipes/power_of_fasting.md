Fasting as a way to break strongholds, especially when facing persistent spiritual attacks. He emphasizes that certain breakthroughs and deliverance require fasting alongside prayer, as Jesus taught in Mark 9:29, where He said, “This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting.”



## Personal Victory and Overcoming Strongholds

Fasting is seen as a powerful weapon for personal victory over sin, temptation, and demonic oppression. It helps individuals grow spiritually, receive clarity, and regain control over their lives.
