# Deliverance from Demonic Oppression

## Purpose of Favent Prayers

Prayers break the power of demonic forces, release people from the bondage of sin, and restore spiritual health.


## Breaking Curses and Altars:

1. **Breaking inherited curse** - Every inherited curse from my father's house, I command you to break in the name of Jesus!.


2. **Breaking generational curse** - I renounce and break every generational curse over my life, and I claim the victory of Jesus over every ancestral covenant.


3. **Altar of my father's house** - I command every altar of my father's house that is working against my destiny be destroyed and burn to ashes in Jesus name!
