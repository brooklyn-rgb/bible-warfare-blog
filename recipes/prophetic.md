# The Power of Prophecy

1. **The Prophetic**

Prophetic ministry, is where we claims to receive direct revelations from God to speak into the lives of individuals, communities, and nations.

## Prophecy as a Tool for Direction and Deliverance: 

He teaches that prophecy is a powerful tool to guide people into their destiny, providing answers, guidance, and encouragement. Through prophecy, God reveals hidden things that can change the course of a person’s life.


Prophets are not just fortune tellers but vessels through which God brings instruction, correction, confirmation, and guidance. His teachings emphasize the importance of recognizing true prophets who bring God's word and not merely entertainment or speculation.



## The Prophetic

When God sends a prophet, He sends them with an agenda for your life. A true prophet doesn’t just show you your past; they bring you into your future.


### PRAYER: 

Father, I receive the prophetic word for my life today! Let Your will be established through every prophecy declared over me.
