# Breaking Financial Strongholds

## Prayer and Spiritual Warfare

Through prayer and spiritual warfare, believers can break free from the spiritual forces that prevent them from experiencing financial breakthroughs, career success, or overall prosperity.


Success is not just material; it includes spiritual and emotional well-being

We aught to believe God for abundant life, both spiritually and materially, by adhering to the principles of faith, obedience, and prayer.


## PRAYER:

1. **Destroying the spirit of poverty** - I command every spirit of poverty, limitation, and failure to leave my life. I claim financial breakthrough in the name of Jesus!"
